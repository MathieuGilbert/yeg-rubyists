A project to display the yegrb rubyists activity

Installation:
Git clone
Update twitter oauth -> config/initializers/twitter.rb
Create a few users
Run rails console -> DataParser.update_data (should populate data based on users).

Errors?
You need to have at least 1 item per column before backbone can pick up the items.
DataParser.update_data's job is to populate the initial data

Common Errors:

Twitter column not showing up?
Make sure you have the twitter oauth account setup correctly (and the keys updated).

Blog column not showing up?
Make sure the blog url is in Atom format (not RSS). IE: http://www.ryanonrails.com/feed/atom/
